//                             If you've started your own business, you will likely hear this question a lot. Since founding TechTee, I've often been encouraged to choose one niche. After all, luxury, fashion, banking and finance are completely different worlds, right? But to me, this couldn't be more wrong.<br /><br />
//                             The three core values at my company are creativity, purpose and efficiency. They are also essential attributes to the industries we provide service to. But the biggest link between them is their target market: consumers who have a lot of disposable income who like to be treated well.<br /><br />
//                             <span>Influence plays an important role in the fashion and finance world.</span><br /><br />
//                             Consumers love to feel as if our buying decisions arise from our own minds. I tricked myself into this way of thinking recently. This spring I've been swapping out my usual blues and blacks for hot pinks - unaware of how much this trend was on the rise. Pink blazers, dresses and more were filling up the high streets (and my wardrobe). But there I was, unaware of how much I was being influenced. I'm sure Miranda Priestly would have scoffed at me!<br /><br />
//                             The world of banking works in the same way. One of our clients is a private bank whose customer, a high profile business owner, wanted his financial account owners to have more ownership and not rely on one or two logins. We built a software feature that allowed for multiple users to log in and name tag transactions. A couple of years later, we joined a huge high street bank on a digital transformation project. One of the first features they asked us to build was the same type of software feature with multiple users and tagging options. It was amazing to see the influence of the private banking sector trickle down to the high street.<br /><br />
//                             <span>Technology helps fashion and finance thrive.</span><br /><br />
//                             As a society, we have always looked forward to what the future of technological fashion holds. The science-fiction films we have grown up on made us believe we’d have self-lacing shoes and more by now.<br /><br />
//                             Whilst we don't all own high-tech shoes, technology helps fashion move into the future. As a collective, there is now more demand for sustainable fashion. We now have clothes made to grow with the children who wear them.<br /><br />

//                             We are already seeing the digital transformation of the banking and finance worlds. From Digital Account Opening to Cloud Computing and APIs. But how will AI and CryptoCurrency impact the banks of the future?<br /><br />
//                             <span>Fashion and banking in the pandemic era.</span><br /><br />
//                             Companies have always had to rise to occasions to meet the needs of their consumers. But the events of the last year have been pivotal in the types of obstacles brands now face. We experienced the first-ever remote fashion shows. Luxury fashion brands increased digital experiences in many ways. During this strange era, we worked with La Perla, Gucci and Penhaligons on digital projects to showcase their brand and products. Their needs were all different, but all were created during a time where creativity, purpose and efficiency were more important than ever.<br /><br />
//                             The finance world also adapted to different strategies during this time. Banks ramped up their usage of social media ads. We even saw Coutts run Instagram ads for the first time - which was a shocking moment.<br /><br />
//                             On top of all this change, we have also seen the industries learn from each other over the last year. From the luxury sector reassessing the importance of finance as a key asset to conversations on what banking can learn from luxury fashion.<br /><br />
//                             <span>We will continue to digitally transform the fashion and finance world.</span><br /><br />
//                             The intersections between luxury, fashion, banking and finance are endless. Our specialisations help us to understand the needs of their target market. We can offer creative technical solutions for our clients. Empowering them to showcase their products and meet the personalised expectations of their customers.<br /><br />
//                             If you are reading this as a business owner yourself, who has frustrations surrounding choosing a niche, I see you. I hope this piece has helped you feel validated in your decisions.<br /><br />
//                             Whilst I do still feel frustrated when advised to choose one specialism, I think our work at TechTee speaks for itself. As a team, we thrive not only by our range of clients, but our specialist services. Digital strategy, UX research, design and software development are all expert services that our team of creative technologists provide.<br /><br />
